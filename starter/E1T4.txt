Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

# Poor practice 1
Regarding to S3 template. It does not mention encryption. For sensitive data (like in S3BucketRecipesSecret), this is crucial.

# Poor practice 2
The private subnets are configured with a default route to the Internet Gateway (DefaultPrivateRoute1 and DefaultPrivateRoute2).
This is unusual for private subnets as they typically route outbound traffic through a NAT Gateway.

I'm worried about whether it can connect to the internet or not, maybe we need to configure public IP for EC2 resources. But it still weird

# Poor practice 3
Allow all actions "s3:*" on all resources "*" that can lead to potential security risks, we should restrict access to only neccessary resources

# Poor practice 4
For WebAppSG, the unrestricted SSH access (port 22) which allows unrestricted access from and to the internet. we should restrict the IP range
